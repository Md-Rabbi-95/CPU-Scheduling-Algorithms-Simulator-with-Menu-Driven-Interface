# CPU-Scheduling-Algorithms-Simulator-with-Menu-Driven-Interface
This project simulates various CPU Scheduling Algorithms used in operating systems. It provides a menu-driven interface that allows users to input process details (like arrival time, burst time, and priority) and select from a list of algorithms to compute scheduling results. The program calculates and displays average waiting time, turnaround time, Gantt charts, and detailed process tables.

ðŸ“‹ Algorithms Implemented:
1.First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
2.Shortest Job First (SJF) - Non-preemptive
3.Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) - Preemptive SJF
4.Priority Scheduling - Preemptive and Non-preemptive
5.Round Robin (RR)
